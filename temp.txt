modelling:

N: number of passengers (i = 1, N)
passenger i wants to go to i + N

K: capacity

2N + 1 points (0 to 2N)
shortest route?

auxiliary location: 2N + 1, the same as 0
next[i] = j: next of i is j, [0, 2N] -> [1, 2N + 1]
    - next[i] != i
    - all different
num_passengers[i] : number of passengers after leaving i, [0, 2N] -> [0, K]
